# Open Ecosystem Services

Reference implementation scaffold for **shared identity, consent, audit, catalog, policy and observability services**, derived from the doctoral framework *Adaptive AI-Assisted Orchestration and Semantic Interoperability for Serverless Microservices in Hybrid Open Industry Ecosystems*.

> Status: research scaffold. It uses synthetic examples and is not a production certification or regulatory-compliance claim.

## Architecture

The repository applies a provider-neutral, event-aware architecture with:

- governed API entry and explicit OpenAPI contracts;
- CloudEvents and AsyncAPI for asynchronous interoperability;
- identity, consent, audit, catalog, policy and observability services;
- Saga, CQRS, Outbox/Inbox, idempotency, Circuit Breaker and DLQ where justified;
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation and policy-as-code controls;
- Kubernetes/OpenShift deployment assets without hard-coding one cloud provider.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `contracts/` | OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and CloudEvents schemas |
| `docs/` | Architecture, domain model and ADRs |
| `examples/` | Synthetic requests and events |
| `infrastructure/` | Kubernetes/OpenShift and Helm assets |
| `observability/` | OpenTelemetry configuration |
| `operators/appdeployer/` | S2I, Tekton and Argo CD application-delivery operator |
| `policies/` | Rego policies for baseline governance |
| `services/` | Domain and transversal microservices |
| `tests/` | Contract, integration, resilience and performance tests |

## Quick start

```bash
make validate
make test
```

## Core interoperability envelope

Every request or event should carry `correlation_id`, `causation_id`, `schema_version`, `tenant_id`, purpose and data-classification metadata. Domain data must remain synthetic until an approved privacy and governance process exists.

## Roadmap

1. Implement the first domain service under `services/`.
2. Add executable contract tests.
3. Add a reproducible local event broker profile.
4. Add OpenShift deployment overlays.
5. Validate latency, throughput, error rate, trace coverage and recovery.

## AppDeployer Operator

The [`operators/appdeployer`](operators/appdeployer/) module implements environment-aware application delivery for conventional Kubernetes/OpenShift workloads and Knative/OpenShift Serverless services. Development resources execute CI with Tekton and publish a GitOps change; production resources never build and instead validate an existing OCI image before promoting it through GitOps and Argo CD.
