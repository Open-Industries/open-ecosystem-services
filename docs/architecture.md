# Reference architecture

## Scope

Open Ecosystem Services supports shared identity, consent, audit, catalog, policy and observability services. The design separates domain services from shared ecosystem capabilities.

## Logical flow

1. API Gateway validates identity, quota and contract.
2. Consent and policy services authorize purpose and data use.
3. Semantic mediation maps external vocabularies to the canonical model.
4. Domain services perform local transactions.
5. Outbox publishes CloudEvents; Inbox and idempotency protect consumers.
6. Saga coordinates multi-service workflows and explicit compensations.
7. Audit and OpenTelemetry preserve end-to-end evidence.

## Quality attributes

- Interoperability: versioned OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and semantic mappings.
- Security: Zero Trust, least privilege and policy as code.
- Resilience: timeouts, bounded retries, circuit breakers, DLQ and replay control.
- Observability: correlated metrics, logs, traces and audit records.
- Portability: provider-neutral contracts and Kubernetes/OpenShift assets.

## AI-assisted adaptation

AI may recommend routing, concurrency or patterns from latency, error, backlog and cost signals. Policy limits, confidence thresholds, explanations, deterministic fallback and human approval remain mandatory for high-risk actions.
